Hi, I am Shanaz Chowdhery Witt // @ShanazCW. ðŸ‘‹ I am the Chief of Staff - Revenue @GitHub and love supporting our revenue organization. 

I'm based in Virginia. I'm also a papercraft enthusiast (ask me about my holiday cards) and deeply passionate about pathways for social mobility. Through my work at General Assembly and mentorship efforts across Byte Back, Year Up, Streetwise Partners, and OOO Hours, I've helped thousands of people change careers. I enjoy mentoring and helping people pursue the work they love.
